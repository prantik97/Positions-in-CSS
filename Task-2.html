    <h1>Difference between css position absolute versus relative</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3 class="intro">When we want to design complex layouts, we'll need to change the typical document flow and
        override the
        default browser styles.</h3>
    <h3 class="intro2">To do the above, and much more, we'll use CSS's position property.This property takes in five
        values: static,
        relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.
        Here we'll focus on the relative and absolute values.</h3>

    <h3 class="intro3"> <span style="font-size: 20px; background-color: gold;">position: relative;</span> changes the
        position of the element relative to the parent element and relative to itself
        and where it would usually be in the regular document flow of the page. This means that it's relative to its
        original position within the parent element.It moves the tag based on where it currently is, relative to its
        usual place and relative to its surrounding tags without affecting their layout.
        Note: we will use top,right,bottom and left property in css to change the position. below is an example-
    </h3>
    <h4 class="cssProp">
        <p>.two {</p>
        <p>top: 15px;</p>
        <p>left: 20px;</p>
        <p> background-color: royalblue;</p>
        <p>position: relative;</p>
        <p> }</p>
    </h4>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child one">One</div>
        <div class="child two">Two</div>
        <div class="child three">Three</div>
        <div class="child four">Four</div>
    </div>
    <p>Above we used position:retative to the box "Two" to change the position of the box 15px from top and 20px from
        left with respect to its parent container.</p>
    <h3 class="intro3"> <span style="font-size: 20px; background-color: gold;">position: absolute;
        </span>  Position an element based on its closest positioned ancestor position.
        below is an example-
    </h3>
    <h4 class="cssProp">
        <p>.two2 {</p>
        <p>top: 830px;</p>
        <p>left: 400px;</p>
        <p> background-color: royalblue;</p>
        <p>position: absolute;</p>
        <p> }</p>
    </h4>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child one1">One</div>
        <div class="child two2">Two</div>
        <div class="child three3">Three</div>
        <div class="child four4">Four</div>
    </div>
    <p>Above we used position:absolute to the box "Two" and change the position of the box 830px from top and 400px from
        left with respect to its parent container. Absolute-positioned elements are completely taken out of the regular
        flow of the web page.

        They are not positioned based on their usual place in the document flow, but based on the position of their
        ancestor.

        In the example above, the absolutely positioned square is inside a statically positioned parent.

        This means it will be positioned relative to the whole page itself, which means relative to the &lt;html&gt;
        element â€“ the root of the page.</p>
